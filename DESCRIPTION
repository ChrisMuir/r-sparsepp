Description: Provides interface to sparsepp - fast, memory efficient hash map. 
    It is derived from Google's excellent sparsehash implementation.
    We believe Sparsepp provides an unparalleled combination of performance and memory usage, 
    and will outperform your compiler's unordered_map on both counts. 
    Only Google's dense_hash_map is consistently faster, at the cost of much greater 
    memory usage (especially when the final size of the map is not known in advance).
